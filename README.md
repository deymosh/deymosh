## About
Embedded and systems engineer with deep experience in RTOS and OS development. Expertise in C and assembly, low-level debugging, boot flow, deterministic designs for constrained hardware, and practical tooling to make embedded development repeatable and testable.

---

## What I do
- Design and integrate RTOS features: schedulers, timing, resource accounting, and deterministic behavior.  
- Develop kernel components: memory management, IPC, device drivers, and interrupt-safe code.  
- Work on bootloaders, startup code, toolchains and board bring-up for constrained hardware.  
- Build deployable tooling (containers, CI) to simplify reproducible firmware and service deployment.

---

## Skills & Tools
- Languages: C, Assembly  
- OS & low-level: RTOS internals, kernel architecture, bootloaders, device drivers  
- Tooling: Docker, GCC toolchains, OpenOCD, GDB, QEMU, Make  
- VCS & CI: Git, GitHub Actions

---

## Projects
- [nostr-relay](https://github.com/deymosh/nostr-relay) — nostr-rs-relay + proxy-dashboard. Setup and integration for running a nostr relay with a dashboard; useful for deployment and experimentation with relay tooling.
